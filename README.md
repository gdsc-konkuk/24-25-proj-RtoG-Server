# 🔥 RtoG: Wildfire Fast Detection Server (Red to Green)

This repository powers the RtoG (Red to Green) server — an AI-driven system for fast and accurate wildfire detection.
It uses YOLOv8 for real-time object detection and integrates Gemini Vision API for verification, enabling early fire detection from video footage like CCTV or drone sources.

From red (wildfire) to green (safe forest) — detect fast, act faster.

## 🚀 Project Structure (Mono Repository)

This project has been refactored into a monorepo with independent virtual environments:

```

│   ├── venv/             # App server virtual environment
│   └── requirements.txt  # App server dependencies
│
├── preprocessing/        # Image preprocessing tools
│   ├── venv/             # Preprocessing virtual environment
│   └── requirements.txt  # Preprocessing dependencies

## 💻 Virtual Environment Setup

Each project uses an independent virtual environment to prevent dependency conflicts:

### server
```bash
cd server
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### preprocessing
```bash
cd preprocessing
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### model-training
```bash
cd model-training
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
